### Team Approach to Work
- Collaboration and teamwork
- Good work culture
- Communication about blockers
- Agendas should be brief/minimal
- Developers "start" and "finish" stories, PO "delivers" them
- Attend meetings or inform about unavailibility
- Always squash and merge
- Give scrum updates daily on slack
- Add coverage% of tests and rubocop offenses in the description of PR
- Delete stale branches after merging to main
- Finish work by Wednesday of the sprint deadline to allow for testing and merge conflict resolution
- Ask for help!!
