## Team Name: AggieAssign

## Summary
The main customer need is to have an application that creates an **efficient classroom schedule** which for each course section, assigns a time, a room, and an instructor, while satisfying a range of constraints. These constraints include room capacity, instructor availability, teaching style requirements, and course conflicts. The system also needs to consider instructor preferences, such as desired teaching times and course preferences, in order to maximize their satisfaction. The application provides a solution by providing an easy to understand interface which allows the user to upload data, preferences and constraints as csv files. It then automatically generates a schedule that meets both hard constraints and soft preferences, while minimizing wasted classroom space and balancing instructor workloads. The application will have additional features such as the ability to manually override schedules and see detailed schedule views, as well as export the generated schedules for easy sharing.

The key stakeholder for this application is the Associate Department Head, who is responsible for creating the teaching schedule before every semester. The secondary stakeholders are the Instructors and Students, who benefit indirectly from having flexible course schedules. The application integrates all scheduling requirements into one platform, allowing for streamlined data input, constraint satisfaction, and schedule optimization, while being scalable for future adjustments.
